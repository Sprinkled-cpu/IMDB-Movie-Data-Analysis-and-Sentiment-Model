# ðŸŽ¬ IMDB Movie Data Analysis & Sentiment Prediction

This project explores the IMDB movie reviews dataset to uncover insights about viewer sentiment and builds a machine learning model to classify reviews as positive or negative. It combines data analysis, visualization, and NLP-based sentiment modeling.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on IMDB reviews
- Visualize word frequency, sentiment distribution, and review length
- Build a sentiment classification model using NLP techniques
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

ðŸ§  Model Architecture
Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming

Feature extraction: TF-IDF or word embeddings

Classifier: Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / LSTM (optional)

ðŸ“Š Sample Visualizations
Word clouds for positive and negative reviews

Sentiment distribution histogram

Review length vs sentiment scatter plot

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
Model	Accuracy	F1 Score
Logistic Regression	89.2%	0.89
Naive Bayes	87.5%	0.87
LSTM (optional)	91.3%	0.91


ðŸ“Œ Extensions
Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

Integrate real-time review scraping from IMDB

Use BERT or other transformer models for improved accuracy
